### Analysis

You can consult the flow diagrams in the folder **diagrams** included with the code.

**Problem:** Users wants to have a record of expenses.

**Problem analysis:**

  - Date
 
* Application desktop first

* Components to develop:
  - Dashboard: to check a history of expenses by date 1 month limit
  - New Expense: to register a new expense with the **data**

### Design and Inspiration

We took our inspiration by watching dashboards on the web and applications like pinterest.

Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/dcASTW1DA1ZOgT733tss3S/Save-my-money?node-id=0%3A1
